# Homework 3 - Random Password Generator
Random Password Generator is a password creation application that can be used to make secure passwords with specific user criteria. Enjoy!

## Installation
Since I only used links and HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all you need to do to run my site locally, is clone it!

## Usage
Users must first input a valid password length and at least 1 password criteria. After that, clicking the button will
generate a secure password according to the criteria set by the user.

## Credits
I used Bootstrap to style my project. Access [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) on their webiste!
